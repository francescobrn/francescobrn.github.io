Hello I am Francesco Bruno, an Automation and Control Engineer with a passion for robotics and cutting-edge technology. After graduating from Politecnico di Milano, I moved to Lausanne to complete my Master's thesis at the EPFL’s Reconfigurable Robotics Lab, where I designed a robotics control framework that aimed to bring physical immersione inside virtual environments. This experience deepened my expertise in control systems, human-machine interfaces, 3D simulation, and communication technologies.

Currently, I work at MIROS Technology, a startup focused on optimizing and digitalizing human workspaces by developing robotic smart surfaces and fully automated spaces to enhance human-environment interactions. I handled various stages of the product development life cycle, from custom PCB design and embedded control with Arduino to graphic UI design with Unreal Engine and JavaScript. I also worked on full-stack development and MQTT network architecture. My role has exposed me to prototyping, soldering, and hardware assembly. Overseeing our product’s first delivery has not only provided me with project management and problem solving skills but also strengthened my ability to collaborate across diverse technical teams.

I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative solutions that push the boundaries of robotics, automation, and human-centric design.

I hold a **B.Sc.** (2021) and an **M.Sc.** (2024) in **Automation and Control Engineering** from [**Politecnico di Milano**](https://www.polimi.it/), where I developed my master’s thesis under the supervision of Professor Jamie Paik at the [Reconfigurable Robotics Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rrl/).
